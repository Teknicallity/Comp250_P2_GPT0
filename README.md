# Comp250_P2_GPT0
A project to explore the concept of linked lists and graphs.

You are first asked for a text file, ideally being a book. Then the amount of words to be strung together. The higher the number, the better the output will be, at the cost of originality. Finally, it needs a set of starting keywords.

This project explores the following concepts:
- Custom linked lists for specific requirements
- Graphs
- Text file processing
